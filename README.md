Air is one of the most common types of domestic transportation in the United States. Due to the colossal amount of people connected through these transportation methods, it forms a vast transportation network. In this paper, we use complex network concepts and methods to analyze the development of the US Domestic Airline Network from 2009 to 2018. Methods and models employed in this paper include **Centrality**, **Assortativity**, **Small-World Properties**, **Scale-Free properties**, and **Targeted Attack Tolerance**. This study demonstrates the consolidation of the **Hub-and-Spoke system** of the industry and particularly focuses on the rise and fall of the small airports in the system.
